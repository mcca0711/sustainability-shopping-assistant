2. Generating Synthetic data
Key Highlights:

Product Attributes: Your synthetic product data includes essential attributes like ProductID, Name, Brand, Category, Barcode, SustainabilityRating, and Price.
Streamlit Integration: The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly way to generate and visualize the product database on-demand.
Data Persistence: The generated data is saved to data/products.csv, ensuring persistence for future use.
Completing Step 2: Expanding Synthetic Data
While generating the product database is a significant achievement, Step 2 encompasses more than just products. To ensure comprehensive synthetic data for your application, let's extend the data generation to include:

Sample Shopping Lists (shopping_lists.csv)
Alternative Product Suggestions (alternative_products.csv)
By incorporating these additional datasets, you'll have a well-rounded synthetic data foundation to support various app functionalities.

2a. Generate Sample Shopping Lists
Purpose: Simulate user shopping behavior by creating shopping lists containing multiple products.

Explanation:

Function generate_shopping_lists: Creates shopping lists for a specified number of users, each containing a random selection of products.
Data Storage: Shopping lists are saved as shopping_lists.csv with Items stored as semicolon-separated barcodes for easier parsing.
Streamlit Interface: Added a button to generate shopping lists, which appears after the product database is generated.
Usage:

Generate Product Database: Click the "Generate Product Database" button first to ensure products.csv exists.
Generate Shopping Lists: Once the product database is available, click the "Generate Shopping Lists" button to create and view sample shopping lists.
2b. Generate Alternative Product Suggestions
Purpose: Provide eco-friendly alternatives for products with lower sustainability ratings.

Implementation:

We'll add functionality to map products to their high-sustainability alternatives within the same category.

Explanation:

Function generate_alternative_products: For each product that doesn't have a High sustainability rating, this function finds up to three high-sustainability alternatives within the same category.
Data Storage: Alternative suggestions are saved as alternative_products.csv with AlternativeSuggestions stored as semicolon-separated product names.
Streamlit Interface: Added a button to generate alternative products, which requires the product database to be present.
Usage:

Generate Product Database: Click "Generate Product Database" if not already done.
Generate Alternative Products: Click "Generate Alternative Products" to create and view alternative suggestions.

3. Visualize metrics

3.1. Define Key Metrics
To effectively monitor your application's performance and user interactions, it's essential to identify and define the key metrics you want to track. Based on your initial requirements and synthetic data, here's a breakdown of both Business Metrics and ML/DL Metrics:

A. Business Metrics
User Acquisition Rate

Definition: Number of new users registering per week/month.
Calculation: Count of unique UserIDs over time.
User Retention Rate

Definition: Percentage of users who continue using the app over a specified period.
Calculation: (Number of returning users) / (Total users) * 100.
Engagement Metrics

Average Time Spent on App
Definition: Average duration a user spends per session.
Note: Requires session tracking data (not currently in synthetic data).
Number of Sessions per User
Definition: Average number of times a user interacts with the app.
Note: Requires session tracking data.
Feature Usage Metrics

Pre-Trip Analysis Usage
Definition: Number of users uploading shopping lists.
Calculation: Count of shopping lists uploaded.
In-Store Scanning Usage
Definition: Number of barcodes scanned per user.
Note: Requires barcode scanning data.
Sustainability Impact Metrics

Number of Sustainable Alternatives Selected
Definition: How often users choose recommended eco-friendly products.
Calculation: Count of alternative products selected.
Estimated Reduction in Carbon Footprint
Definition: Aggregate data showing environmental impact of users' choices.
Note: Requires carbon footprint data per product.
Conversion Rate

Definition: Percentage of recommendations that lead to actual purchases.
Calculation: (Number of recommendations accepted) / (Total recommendations) * 100.
Note: Requires tracking of recommendation acceptance.
Customer Satisfaction Score

Definition: User ratings and feedback.
Note: Requires user feedback data.
B. ML/DL Metrics
Since the ML/DL models are yet to be developed, we'll outline the metrics you can track once they're in place:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Accuracy

Definition: Percentage of correctly recognized characters/words from uploaded images.
Calculation: (Number of correct recognitions) / (Total recognitions) * 100.
Barcode Scanning Success Rate

Definition: Percentage of successful barcode scans.
Calculation: (Successful scans) / (Total scan attempts) * 100.
Product Sustainability Classification Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Definition: Metrics to evaluate the classification performance.
Calculation: Based on true positives, false positives, etc.
Recommendation System Metrics

Click-Through Rate (CTR)
Definition: How often users interact with recommendations.
Calculation: (Clicks on recommendations) / (Total recommendations displayed) * 100.
Conversion Rate
Definition: Recommendations leading to selection/purchase.
Calculation: As defined above.
Mean Average Precision (MAP)
Definition: For ranking the recommendations.
Calculation: Average precision across all queries.
